12.Write a program to accept number of circles N and radius and coordinates of center (x,y) for each circle. Select appropriate data structure and explain why you chose it. Arrange the circles in increasing order of their area and print all the data of each circle.		
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int n,r1,x1,y1;
	cout << "Enter the nuber of circles" << endl;
	cin >> n;
	int* x;
	x = new int[n];
	int* y;
	y = new int[n];
	int* r;
	r = new int[n];
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cout << "Enter the co-erdinates of circle" << endl;
		cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
		cout << "Enter the radius of this circle" << endl;
		cin >> r[i];
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
			if (r[i] > r[j]) {
				r1 = r[i];
				r[i] = r[j];
				r[j] = r1;
				x1 = x[i];
				x[i] = x[j];
				x[j] = x1;
				y1 = y[i];
				y[i] = y[j];
				y[j] = y1;

	cout << "The ascending order of cricles as per area is" << endl;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cout << "Co-ordinates " << x[i] << " " << y[i] << " radius " << r[i] << endl;
